This also applies to the models learned by neural networks: given some training data and a network architecture, there are multiple sets of weights values (multiple models) that could explain the data, and simpler models are less likely to overfit than complex ones.\n","\n","A \"simple model\" in this context is a model where the distribution of parameter values has less entropy (or a model with fewer parameters altogether, as we saw in the section above). Thus a common way to mitigate overfitting is to put constraints on the complexity of a network by forcing its weights only to take small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more \"regular\". This is called \"weight regularization\", and it is done by adding to the loss function of the network a cost associated with having large weights. This cost comes in two flavors:\n","\n","* L1 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the absolute value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the \"L1 norm\" of the weights).\n","\n","* L2 regularization, where the cost added is proportional to the square of the value of the weights coefficients (i.e. to what is called the \"L2 norm\" of the weights). L2 regularization is also called weight decay in the context of neural networks. Don't let the different name confuse you: weight decay is mathematically the exact same as L2 regularization.\n","\n","In Keras, weight regularization is added by passing weight regularizer instances to layers as keyword arguments.

Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. set to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector [0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1] for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. [0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n","\n","In tf.keras you can introduce dropout in a network via the Dropout layer, which gets applied to the output of layer right

variances of each layers input of your network to be nice. You do not want them to go to zero nor do you want them to explode. Ideally you want everything be normalized throughout your network. Batch normalization is a new technique that does this: it just takes the batch mean and standard deviation of each of our features (i.e. for each pixel across the data) and then sets its value to be such that it has zero mean and unit variance.\n","\n","It turns out that this function is differentiable and we can backpropagate it! By inserting now a batch normalization layer in our network we will take in as input some x and normalize it. So for a given input activation we can apply this normalization independently across our batch. So the hope is that by doing this the network will learn faster because it will not have to adapt to changes in the distribution of the inputs it receives.\n","\n","Benefits of BN\n","* Improves gradient flow through network\n","* Allow higher learning rates\n","* Reduce strong dependency on initialization\n","* Acts as a form of regularization\n","Note:\n","  * at test time BN layer works differently\n","  * Mean and Std not computed based on batch (since you might want to predict single images)\n","  * Use a running mean and std. (maintained during training)\n","\n","One more subtle issue is that it actually acts as a form of regularization. The way it acts as a regularizer is that with BN, if you have some input x, and it goes through the network then its representation in the network is also influenced by all the other examples in your batch since we use the batch mean and variance. So BN is using all the images of the batch a particular image was sampled in. So it randomizes the images position in the representation space which has a nice regularizing effect.\n","\n","Note that at test time the BN layer acts differently. At test time, we want it to be a deterministic function. So we need to remember our mean and variance across the dataset. We can either compute it over all our data or much easier is to have a running mean and variance while training and then use that directly."],"metadata":{"id":"-QMJB5K0RIZ7"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from keras.layers import BatchNormalization\n","\n","def get_batchnorm_model():    \n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=(150, 150, 3)))\n","    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n","    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n","    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n","\n","    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3)))\n","    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n","    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n","    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n","\n","    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3)))\n","    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n","    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n","    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n","    \n","    model.add(Flatten())  # this converts our 3D feature maps to 1D feature vectors\n","    model.add(Dense(64))\n","    model.add(BatchNormalization())\n","    model.add(Activation('relu'))\n","    model.add(Dense(1))\n","    model.add(Activation('sigmoid'))\n","    \n","    return model"],"metadata":{"id":"saeP7-tYQoKX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657107515327,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"kapoorlabsintern India","userId":"14906127815508473654"}}},"execution_count":51,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","m_bn = get_batchnorm_model()\n","\n","m_bn.compile(optimizer=\"rmsprop\",\n","             loss=\"binary_crossentropy\", \n","             metrics=['accuracy'])\n","\n","# we use only about half as many iterations since batch norm makes learning quicker\n","hist_bn = m_bn.fit_generator(train_generator,\n","                             epochs=int(0.5 * epochs),\n","                             steps_per_epoch=2000 // batch_size,\n","                             validation_data=validation_generator,\n","                             validation_steps=800 // batch_size)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":252},"id":"Kk-54xTlQoHg","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1657107515328,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"kapoorlabsintern India","userId":"14906127815508473654"}},"outputId":"c1c359f0-3856-4928-d84b-b7f173f20ffe"},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-52-8c1e3024afb6>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      7\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      8\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# we use only about half as many iterations since batch norm makes learning quicker\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 9\u001b[0;31m hist_bn = m_bn.fit_generator(train_generator,\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m     10\u001b[0m                              \u001b[0mepochs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0mint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m0.5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m*\u001b[0m \u001b[0mepochs\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m     11\u001b[0m                              \u001b[0msteps_per_epoch\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m\u001b[0;36m2000\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m//\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbatch_size\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'train_generator' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plot_histories([('batch_norm', hist_bn), \n","                ('baseline', hist_base)], keys=['loss'])"],"metadata":{"id":"uM9YeZGfQoEp","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1657107515327,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"kapoorlabsintern India","userId":"14906127815508473654"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Using data augmentation\n","In order to make the most of our few training examples, we will \"augment\" them via a number of random transformations, so that our model would never see the exact same picture twice.
